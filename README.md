# dicom-protos
DICOM Protocol Buffer Representations 

# Quick Start

1. Clone this repo
2. Run the following commmand to compile all protobufs into one proto package.
```
protoc --proto_path=. --go_out=:$GOPATH/src *.proto
```

You can compile to other protobuf supported (languages)[https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#generating]

3. (optional) The `.proto` files can be regenerated by running `go run main.go` from this directory.
